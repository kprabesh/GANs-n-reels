							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>Our research aims to discover if successful AI image generative models can also be used to generate music. We use a Generative Adversarial Network, a particular type of Artificial Neural Network, in an attempt to generate Irish music.</p>
							<p>Irish music, as one of the primary influences on traditional Newfoundland music, tends toward straightforward melodies with a fixed format. It is a style intended to be played with a single instrument by amateur musicians, resulting in notation that is simple and easy to follow. These unique qualities are the primary motivation for choosing Irish music as our target.</p>
							<p>Although there are other neural network based Irish music generators, we found no GANs which successfully generated music. These other neural networks use a prediction based approach to generate music. Unlike other networks, GANs could truly generate music from scratch, rather than using prediction.</p>
							<p>GANs have worked well with pictures, but to our knowledge there has not been a successful attempt to generate music using GANs. Also, to our knowledge, no one has presented the idea of organizing music like a picture, which makes our encoding unique. </p>

							<h2>Background Information</h2>
							<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/irish%20music.jpg" alt="" /></span> In spite of emigration and a well-developed
        						connection to music influences from Britain and the United States, Irish traditional music has kept many
								of its elements and has itself influenced many forms of music, such as the folk music in Newfoundland and
								Labrador. Irish traditional music includes many kinds of songs, including drinking songs, ballads and laments,
								sung unaccompanied or with accompaniment by a variety of instruments.
								Traditional dance music includes reels, hornpipes and jigs. In the nineteenth century folk
								instruments would have included the flute, the fiddle and the uilleann pipes.
    						</p>

							 <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/gan.png" alt="" /></span> An Artificial Neural Network, or ANN, is based on a collection of connected units called nodes.
								These nodes can be loosely compared to neurons in the human brain with
								respect to their interconnectedness and influence on their neighbors.
								There are various types of ANNs, many of which have been successfully used to classify,
								predict, and generate different types of data.
								A Generative Adversarial Network, or a GAN, is an ANN consisting of a Generator
								that generates data when fed noise, and a Discriminator which classifies data.
								A common analogy is the Generator is akin to an art forger, while the Discriminator is
								like a detective. The analogy is useful as, after being trained, the Generator can be used
								to create original ‘art’.

							<h2>Our Approach</h2>
							<p>We hope to use the distinctive structure of Irish tunes to make them suitable for GAN-based music generation. Our main idea is to regard an Irish melody as a fixed-size object with cross-references among its parts: “music as a picture” view. The two key components of this project are: </p>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<ol>
										<li>Preprocessing:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Creating a well-defined format for music encoding suitable for GANs</li>
											<li>Representing “vertical” dependencies in the tunes</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Modifying GANs for improved performance via:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Statistical “Bagging” and “Boosting” to mimic the full input distribution</li>
											<li>Modifying training rate to avoid “Mode Collapse”</li>
										</ul>
